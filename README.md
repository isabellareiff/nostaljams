# nostaljams

### nostaljams is a site that shuffles iconic music separated into categories of:  Disney, Theme songs, Emo #TBTs, R&B, Divas, and Legends Only. When you pick a category, it picks a (Math.)random song to play you through youtube, out of an array of ~20-40 choices. Aggressively click and shuffle your favorite genre, or  let the player run on its own and shuffle through everything.

#### nostaljams currently includes categories of:
- Disney (34 songs)
- Theme Songs (in progress)
- Emo #TBTs (in progress)
- R&B (in progress)
- Divas (in progress)
- Legends Only (in progress)

#### Roadmap:
- Implement all categories by Valentine's Day, meaning at least 20 (later 30+) videos for each team.
- Develop a chrome extension that plays a random or user given video/song/artist when you open a new tab.
- Develop a Mac screensavor that plays a random or user given video/song/artist when it falls asleep.

#### nostaljams is my personal take on various #tbt, nostalgia, and childhood playlists floating around the web.
I made it for myself, because I wanted a fun consolidation of all these songs in one place that could live on the web, and I hadn't found anything that did this, had categories, and incorporated video.

I really hope someone else gets actual use from this, and I love category/video requests, but if you want the same concept with totally different videos (like funny videos, specific youtuber videos, whatever you want), feel free to fork this code and swap out the categories, videos, and stylings for your own preferences there.

Sadly, nostaljams doesn't currently work on mobile devices, as autoplay iframes don't work (as far as I know). If anyone has a workaround for this problem, or ideas on how I can beat this, please drop me a [line](https://twitter.com/izreiff) and let me know!

#### To request a video or category to be added, either tweet me at [@izreiff](https://twitter.com/izreiff) or hit this repo with a Pull request. Please be nice, as I'm only myself, and I'll try to get everything done ASAP.
