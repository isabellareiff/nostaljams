# nostaljams

### nostaljams is a personal take on various #tbt, nostalgia, and childhood playlists that have been floating around spotify for some time now.

#### nostaljams currently includes categories of:
- Disney (34 songs)
- Theme Songs (in progress)
- Emo #TBTs (in progress)
- R&B (in progress)
- Divas (in progress)
- Legends Only (in progress)

Goal: Implement all categories by Valentine's Day, meaning at least 20 (later 30+) videos for each team.
