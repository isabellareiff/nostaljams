# nostaljams

### nostaljams is a personal take on various #tbt, nostalgia, and childhood playlists that have been floating around spotify for some time now.

#### nostaljams currently includes categories of:
- Disney
- Theme Songs
- Emo #TBTs
- R&B
- Divas
- Legends Only

I hope to fully implement all categories by late Feb., meaning at least 15-20 (later 30+) videos for each team.

Goal: have 15 song videos by Feb 5th, and 30 by the end of Feb.

Goal: have 10 laugh videos by Feb 5th, and 20 by the end of Feb.
